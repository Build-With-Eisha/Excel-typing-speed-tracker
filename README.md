# Typing Speed Tracker (Excel + VBA)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **prototype typing speed tracker** built in **Microsoft Excel**.  
It measures typing speed in **Words Per Minute (WPM)** using start and end times recorded with VBA macros.  
The tool includes a typing area, start/end buttons, and a visual keyboard layout for finger placement.  

⚠️ **Note:** This is just a prototype. I am currently working on an **advanced version** with more features such as accuracy measurement, difficulty levels, and performance tracking.

## ✨ Features (Prototype)
- Start and End buttons to control the typing test
- Automatic calculation of typing speed (WPM)
- Timer display showing start time, end time, and total time taken
- Typing area with sample text
- Visual keyboard layout with color‑coded finger placements

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Excel formulas and conditional formatting
- VBA macros for automation (start/end time tracking)
- User interface design in Excel
- Creativity in building a productivity tool from scratch

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the Excel file (`TypingSpeedTracker.xlsm`).
2. Click **Start Test** to begin typing in the text box.
3. Type any passage or text you choose.
4. Click **End Test** when you feel your typing session is complete.
5. The tracker will display your typing speed in WPM and the time taken.

## 🔮 Future Improvements (Advanced Version in Progress)
- Accuracy measurement against reference text
- Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Advanced)
- Logging results over time and visualizing progress with charts
- Gamification with badges and motivational feedback
- Cleaner UI and recruiter‑friendly documentation
